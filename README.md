# Modular Level
using Spark project and Quixel Bridge

Bugs: Minecart messes with a charge script and the gems script in Base spark game.
When I hide spark the enemies still sees it. But if I transport spark away to another location there is a chance he will stay there and not move back. 
If Spark hits an out of bound volume, the minecarts doesn't reset.
