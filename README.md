# Modular Level
using Spark project and Quixel Bridge

Bugs:

Minecart messes with a charge script and the gems script in Base spark game.

When I hide spark the enemies still sees it and attack the invisible spark. When I try to solve this if I disable collision spark dissappears upon exiting the minecart.
If I transport spark away to another location there is a chance he will stay there and not move back. 

If Spark hits an out of bound volume, the minecarts doesn't reset.
